## Putting `integer_sequence` on a diet

* Abstract

    > `std::integer_sequence` and related utilities can be extremely useful in some contexts (e.g. iterating over a tuple with an index). However, they are incredibly cumbersome to use, requiring additional helper functions to introduce a pack. This talk shows how most of the cruft can be removed in C++20, and how our future might look like after "expansion statements" or "pack-introducing structured bindings".
